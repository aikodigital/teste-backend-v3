Thank You for your comment. I recommend following link for your .gitignore.

Great, thanks! It blows my mind that GitHub still does not have it in their pulldown when creating a new repo.

For now, I recommend using dotnet new gitignore. Standard and works well.

Por enquanto, recomendo usar dotnet new gitignore. Padrão e funciona bem.

Valeu pela dica, simples e eficaz!
